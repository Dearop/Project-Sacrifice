# Main Menu Implementation Instructions

## Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions to implement:
1. A blinking "Press E to Start" text on the MainMenuScene
2. A transition to a black screen with dialogue when E is pressed
3. A transition to the BarScene when E is pressed again

## Step 1: Create UI Elements in MainMenuScene
1. Open the MainMenuScene in Unity
2. Right-click on the MainMenuCanvas in the Hierarchy and select UI > Text - TextMeshPro
3. Name it "PressEToStartText"
4. Position it at the bottom of the screen (suggested position: y = -300)
5. Set the text to "Press E to Start"
6. Set the font size to 50 and alignment to center
7. Create a new empty GameObject as a child of MainMenuCanvas and name it "DialoguePanel"
8. Add a CanvasRenderer and Image component to DialoguePanel
9. Set the Image color to black with Alpha = 1 (fully opaque)
10. Set the RectTransform to stretch in all directions (Anchor Presets: stretch-stretch)
11. Add a Text - TextMeshPro component as a child of DialoguePanel
12. Name it "DialogueText"
13. Set the RectTransform to center with appropriate width and height (e.g., 1200x600)
14. Set the font size to 36, alignment to center, and text color to white
15. Make sure DialoguePanel is disabled by default (uncheck the checkbox next to its name in the Inspector)

## Step 2: Add the MainMenuManager Script
1. Create a new empty GameObject in the MainMenuScene and name it "MainMenuManager"
2. Add the MainMenuManager script to this GameObject
3. Assign the references in the Inspector:
   - Press E To Start Text: Assign the PressEToStartText object
   - Dialogue Panel: Assign the DialoguePanel object
   - Dialogue Text: Assign the DialogueText object
4. Verify that the Bar Scene Name is set to "BarScene" (or the exact name of your bar scene file)
5. Customize the Intro Dialogue text if desired

## Step 3: Update Build Settings
1. Open Build Settings (File > Build Settings)
2. Add the MainMenuScene and BarScene to the Scenes in Build list
3. Make sure MainMenuScene is at index 0 (or set it as the active scene)

## Step 4: Test the Implementation
1. Enter Play Mode in the Unity Editor
2. Verify that "Press E to Start" text blinks at the bottom of the screen
3. Press E to see the dialogue screen with the story text
4. Press E again to transition to the BarScene

## Troubleshooting
- If the text doesn't blink, check that the PressEToStartText is properly assigned in the MainMenuManager
- If the dialogue doesn't appear, ensure DialoguePanel and DialogueText are properly set up and assigned
- If the scene doesn't transition to BarScene, verify that the scene name is correct and the scene is included in the Build Settings

## Notes
- The MainMenuManager.cs script handles all the functionality including:
  - Blinking text effect
  - Showing dialogue when E is pressed
  - Loading the BarScene when E is pressed again
- No modifications to the BarScene are needed as specified in the requirements
